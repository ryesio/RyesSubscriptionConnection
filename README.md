# Ryes Connection
Subscription page connection to Ryes


Installation.

1) After creating an account and a campaign at Ryes.io, place subscription.html in the appropriate location in your code. Next open the config.js file.  

You will see the following code below.

var clientName = 'Ryes'; <br>
var campaignName = 'Start Of It All'; <br>
var selectTextForDropDowns = 'Select from below:'; <br>

2) Set the clientName var to the client name you registered your account with on ryes.io. <br>
3) Set the campaignName var to the campaign name you created on your account on ryes.io. <br>
4) If you'd like your drop down to state something different than what is in the selectTextForDropDowns var, you can change it. <br>
<br>
That's it. :)
